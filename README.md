## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup & Usage

### Prerequisites

You need a valid **Unsplash Developer Access Key**.

1.  Register as a developer on Unsplash to get your Access Key.

### Local Setup

Since this is a client-side application, you must replace the placeholder key in `script.js` to run it locally.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/AnantKamat12/unsplash-image-search-app.git](https://github.com/AnantKamat12/unsplash-image-search-app.git)
    cd unsplash-image-search-app
    ```

2.  **Edit `script.js`:**
    Open `script.js` and temporarily replace the placeholder with your actual key:
    ```javascript
    // Change this:
    const accessKey = '$$UNSPLASH_ACCESS_KEY$$'; 
    // To your actual key for local testing:
    const accessKey = 'YOUR_ACTUAL_UNSPLASH_KEY';
    ```

3.  **Run:**
    Open the **`index.html`** file directly in your web browser.

**‚ö†Ô∏è Security Note:** *Before committing any changes to this file, ensure you revert `accessKey` back to the placeholder (`'$$UNSPLASH_ACCESS_KEY$$'`).*
